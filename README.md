# TODO-APP

In this project, we'll be creating a TODO CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) task application using the Vue.js framework. The app will allow users to manage tasks with features such as adding new tasks, updating task details, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks. We'll be leveraging Firebase Realtime Database to store and manage task data.
